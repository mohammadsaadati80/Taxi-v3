# Taxi v3 MDP Model-Free Algorithms

Homework #4, Interactive Learning Course, University of Tehran

The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize with **MDP** problem-solving algorithms assuming the environment is unknown. 
These methods are called **Model-Free** methods in the RL.

In this exercise, we solve the [Taxi v3](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/taxi/) problem by using `SARSA`, `Expected SARSA`, `Q-learning`, `n-step Tree Backup` and `On-Policy Monte Carlo` algorithms.
